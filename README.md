# Seizure-Prediction-using-EEG-Signals-

In this project, we built a classification model to analyze EEG data and classify it into
different categories. EEG data is widely used in neuroscience and medical fields, including the
diagnosis of epilepsy. We used CHB-MIT EEG dataset to train and evaluate your model.

The CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, a collection of EEG recordings of 22 pediatric subjects with intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication to characterize seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention. In all, the onsets and ends of 182 seizures are annotated.
